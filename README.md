## Description
`StarShip` provides users the platform to track stock market data. Users are able to track the market in general or they can search up a specific stock. After searching for a specific stock and checking it's performance through different analyses tools and visualizations (e.g. Fear & Greed Index, Zoomable Time Series, News etc.), the user can decide whether to add the stock in a basket where they can track a shortlist of stocks they were interested in. 

But that's not all! 

Users can also make connections by users they follow and users who follow them. The users can then check each other's baskets either through:
 * The Socials page where they can see who they are following or who are following them. They can then click the link to a specific users baskets page.
 * The Tavern page where users can post their baskets or just their thoughts in general, like other users posts, comment on them, and even follow other users.

Try it for yourself and visit the website here!
